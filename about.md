# About Me

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tripp, a Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience programming in several different languages, environments, and industries. I have been mainly focused on back-end development using C# in the .NET stack for the past 15 years. I also do some front-end development using JavaScript in various frameworks. Lately I have enjoyed working with F#, exploring functional principles so that I can add those to my toolbox as well.

I live in Ringgold, GA with my spouse and our two cats. In my spare time I have been an active member of the [Chattanooga Area .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Chattanooga-Area-NET-User-Group-CHADNUG/) and an organizer for the [Scenic City Summit](https://sceniccitysummit.com/). Other hobbies are PC games, tabletop D&D, beer brewing, electric bass, meditation, kettlebells, and reading.

If you'd like to know more about my experience and education, please view [my resume](https://resume.trippshelnutt.com). Feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or Twitter.

# About This Site

I started this blog just as a fun side project to see what I could put together with some technologies that I don't regularly use at my day job. It has turned out to be a really fun process and I've learned a lot along the way.

Current tech:

- **[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)** - I am using Cloudflare for domain registration and DNS. Cloudflare has a lot of features which I'm not using. DNS is free and the have a useful feature called Page Rules which easily allows me to redirect several domains to this site.
- **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** - Jekyll is a static site generator that allows for lots of customization and renders markdown which I'm using for the blog entries.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - CSS framework that allows for easily building classes in a [composable way](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/extracting-components/#extracting-css-components-with-apply).
- **[Netlify](https://netlify.com)** - Website hosting that provides integration with source control so that my website is automatically deployed whenever I push new files to the `trunk` branch.

Future tech:

- **[Disqus](https://disqus.com)** - I'm not using this yet, but I am currently looking into it for handling comments on blog entries since Jekyll is a static site generator.
- **[NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org)** - NuxtJS is a modern Vue-based JavaScript framework with some interesting features for static site generation. NuxtJS has a module called Content which should be perfect for rendering blog posts in markdown. 

Previous tech:

- **[AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)** - for custom domain and DNS.
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** - I was originally using this for hosting, but then I wanted to get more creative by using a customizable CSS framework, and this wasn't supported by Jekyll in GitHub Pages.
