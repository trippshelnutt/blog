Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tripp, a Software Engineer with 20+ years of experience programming in several different languages, environments, and industries.
I started this blog just as a fun side project to see what I could put together with some technologies that I don't normally use at my day job.
It has turned out to be a really fun process and I've learned a lot along the way.

These are a few of the different tools I used to build this website:

**[AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)** - for custom domain and DNS.

**[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** - Static site generator that allows for lots of customization and renders markdown which I'm using for the blog entries.

**[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** - I was originally using this for hosting, but then I wanted to get more creative by using a customizable CSS framework, and this wasn't supported by Jekyll in GitHub Pages.

**[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - CSS framework that allows for easily building classes in a [composable way](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/extracting-components/#extracting-css-components-with-apply).

**[Netlify](https://netlify.com)** - Website hosting that provides integration with source control so that my website is automatically deployed whenever I push new files to the `master` branch.

**[Disqus](https://disqus.com)** - I'm not using this yet, but I am currently looking into it for handling comments on blog entries since Jekyll is a static site generator.
